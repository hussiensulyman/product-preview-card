## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Position
- Developing Responsive Website for mobile and desktop views
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox property more effectively, use CSS variables, create responsive design and use position property.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```CSS
* {
    --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}

.content{
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    align-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    top: 25%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}


```

### Continued development

I will continue to learn and practice more and more specially with Javascript to be more professional in front-end development.
